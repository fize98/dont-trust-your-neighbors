                <p>This narrative is a true story that took place during my fatherâ€™s career as a prosecutor. All of the events mentioned in the narrative are true facts that happened in a small village located in my native country, Azerbaijan. As a fan of forensics and crime solving, I decided to turn this traumatic incident into an interactive website to share the story in a creative way. Additionally, I decided to transform the narrative into a game/quiz type layout to make the audience engage with the story and enjoy the playfulness at the same time. Moreover, as a Graphic Design student, I decided to give more visual context by adding illustrations of the scenes with a sketchy/hand-drawn style to match the detective solving atmosphere. I chose to use a black background to create an intimidating aesthetic to the website. Typography used in the website is simple white text layout that gives the pages a minimalist look. The font that is used in the website is a typewriter font, which also matches the font that is usually used in the detective files and is more legible than handwriting. In addition to that, using a true life story not only makes the narrative more captivating, but at the same time it makes people realize the consequences of felonies. Overall, I tried to combine two of my favorite subjects, Graphic Design and crime solving, into a new medium, such as coding. Learning to combine two different subjects into a new technique has made this project even more complex and educational at the same time.
